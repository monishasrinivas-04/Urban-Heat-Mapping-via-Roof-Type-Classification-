# Urban-Heat-Mapping-via-Roof-Type-Classification-
Urban Heat Mapping via Roof Type Classification uses computer vision on satellite images to identify roof types and estimate their heat absorption levels. It generates an Urban Heat Sustainability Index (UHSI) to highlight heat-prone zones, supporting eco-friendly and climate-resilient city planning.
